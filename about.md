# About Radio Slipstream

Radio Slipstream is basically me making mixes/playlists to satisfy some arcane craving to find the best songs and their best friends and put them together in a row. It is now largely defunct, but there's some good shit in here.

## Parameters

I put a fair amount of effort into making sure all the songs flow together really nicely, especially in the "mixes", which became everything as I lost the desire to record myself saying things probably to nobody.

I also put a fair amount of effort into ensuring I never played the same song more than once. I keep the giant playlist around as a "I thought this was a real rad track that I should play on my show!" and it's good listening.

## Broadcast history

On [CFMU](https://cfmu.ca/), The Slipstream occupied the following timeslots:

 - January—April, 2005: Wednesday mornings 6-9 am
 - October 2005—August 2006: Monday nights 2-4am
 - September 2006—October 2007: Monday nights 12-2am
 - November 2007—The Futurepast: On the internet and eventually on [mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/radioslipstream/) with decreasing regularity
