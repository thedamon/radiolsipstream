The Sadies like to defy easy categorization. Their sound takes on elements of bluegrass, country rock, surf, and psychedelia, but it’s not such a strange combination: all these allegedly disparate styles sound natural together.

Favourite Colours is a wash of deep bass, clear-ringing picked steel and good old fashioned country twang. The melodies themselves are straightforward but ornamented with musicianship that’s so impeccable it’s often hard to keep track of the complex layers of instrumentation. Many of the songs wouldn’t sound out of place on a Tarantino soundtrack.

I’m not an accomplished Sadies connoisseur, so I can’t compare this to previous albums, but alone it stands as a very accomplished work. This is delicate and beautiful, driving and tuneful music that conjures the welcome simplicity of the wide open and the wind in your hair.
