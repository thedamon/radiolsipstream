Despite Clann Zú being being credited with writing all the music here  
as a band, moreso than other groups, the driving force seems to be the  
singer and lyricist, Declan DeBarra. He wears his ragged heart  
unabashedly on his sleeve, and his distinctive voice is at the centre  
of every song: at times plaintive, shrieking, delicate, or intense.  
The songs are often political, sometimes intensely personal, and most  
paint a bleak picture of desperate struggle and heartbreak (One  
Bedroom Apartment has some of the best lyrics I’ve heard this year).  
The music is appropriately a scratchy, spare base of acoustic voices  
occasionally overwhelmed by bombastic waves of raging guitars,  
violins, and hammering percussion. Declan’s voice shrills sometimes  
disconcertingly and isn’t always on key—the songs often sound rough  
and unpolished, albeit intentionally. Some patches can’t help but  
sound a bit sloppy, though, and it’s not always an easy listen. An  
honest, affective (sic) effort.

7.5/10
