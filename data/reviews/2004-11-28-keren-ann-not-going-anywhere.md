After just 2 or 3 listens Keren Ann Zeidel’s English debut had  
snuggled up against my subconscious. The songs all sounded familiar  
and I already delighted in each one while anticipating the next.

Keren’s style is light, easygoing and very difficult to dislike. Her  
gentle voice caresses your ears as the dreamy but catchy melodies  
float over sparkling guitar arpeggios and strains of violin or piano.  
The album exudes a delicate folky chill-out vibe, but there are some  
louder moments and a good amount of variety within. It is a great  
example of how music can be straightforward and emotional without  
coming across as schmaltz, though it sometimes treads the line  
closely. Like those infinitely enjoyable golden oldies, every song  
brims with honest charm and friendliness.

Understated, relaxing and unabashedly pleasant, it’s not an album for  
all moods or tastes, but I can’t help but think it may be the perfect  
album to take the edge off late night crammings.

9/10
