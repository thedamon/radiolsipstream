It’s easy to think this album is a little silly, or even stupid. On first listen, I was noted to raise my eyebrow in confusion and disbelief when I heard the striking couplet “Did you take tram #7 to heaven? / Did you eat your banana from 7/11?”

Eventually, my incredulity was eroded away by the sweet ’70s arrangements, catchy tunes and often comical lyrics. Jens (who kams vrom Schweeden) sees the world as a big, scary, confusing, and, more often than not, heartbreaking place. It’s hard not to feel sorry for the poor guy.

But it’s nice to hear a songwriter who doesn’t take himself too seriously and keeps his sound simple. Jens is enjoyable, purely for his quietly amusing, over-dramatized tales, and the bright and wonderfully sentimental melodies that accompany them.

4/5
