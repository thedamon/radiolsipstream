My first review for the silhouette this year.. I whipped it up while waiting for the internet to arrive last afternoon without actually getting the CD out of the shrinkwrap. That’s how hardcore I am.

**Idlewild – Warnings/Promises**

Oh, copy control. Thanks to you this CD might “encounter playback problems” on my CD player. Yay! Luckily, I’ve had the whole album in easily burnable MP3s on my hard-drive since January, so it doesn’t bug me too much. At any rate, clearly the copy-control is working!

The upshot of that whole thing is that my anti-copy-control convictions won’t let me recommend buying this CD, which is unfortunate since it’s quite good. While perhaps not as strong as their two previous albums, Warnings/Promises is still definitely worthwhile. Idlewild has that distinctly Britrock sound, so fans of British Sea Power, Snow Patrol or the Killers (who are just pretending to be British) will likely find this of interest. It’s a little less polished, a little more scratchy and rough around the edges (which works to its benefit) than those bands, but it’s still got some fist-pumping choruses and the dancing guitar riffs we fans of the Edge all love so well.
