As can be expected when one lives so close to Toronto, there are a lot of shows (that is, concerts) coming up that I really want to see.

Yes.

Some I want to see more than others.

Italicized shows have been attended. (Parenthesized shows mean I probably won’t go, but are noteworthy). Starred shows I have tickets to.

Here’s a brief, in progress, rundown (this list will hoperfully be kept uptodate, also some weblistings contradict each other, so I might not be sure wtf):

Oct 11: The New Pornographers – Kool Haus – Toronto – $20.50
