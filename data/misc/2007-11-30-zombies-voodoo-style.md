OK.. this is just really cool.

I get exposed to a lot of talk about zombies… zombocalypses, survival tactics, discussions on what technically constitutes such a beast. And why shouldn’t I? I am a geek after all!  Sometimes I try to be too cool for all the zombie talk, and then I hear a song like this one.

From Exuma’s 1970 self titled debut album of “voodooed-out Bahamian folk,” this is a weird, tribal footstomper of a tune… and yes, it is most definitely about zombies.

_There is no star in the sky, I see fire in the dead man’s eye._
