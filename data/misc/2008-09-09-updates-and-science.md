It’s been a while, but things are percolating nicely; have no fear! I realized yesterday that the real reason I was being so sloppy at actually getting the next show done was somewhere in my subconscious I was waiting for TV on the Radio’s Dear Science to leak before I carried on with things. Now that it has, I will seclude myself away for several days to soak it up like a sea sponge in the sea breeze underwater. And then I’ll figure out how to perfect next show’s playlist without just playing the whole album.. cause gosh darn it… it’s really fucking good, guys. Rly fukin gud.

So, new episode on the way soon (and I’ve also been working on some new mix cds which will see the light before too long).

Thanks for being here.
