I got linked to [this interview](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/46235-interview-subtle) with [Subtle](http://www.subtle6.com/)&#8216;s idea man, rapper, vocalist, poet and potential nut job DoseOne (born Adam Drucker).  I strongly encourage y’all to check it out. It was definitely one of the most entertaining interviews I’ve ever read, and really raises some questions about art, sanity, reality etc.  What a great fucking trip. High weirdness.
