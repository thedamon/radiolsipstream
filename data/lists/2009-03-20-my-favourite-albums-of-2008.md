It has really gotten so far into the next year that it’s about time I either forgot about bothering to mention my favourite albums of last year, or just got it out of the way. I really enjoyed the [countdown episode](http://www.radioslipstream.com/playlists/2008/01/top-25-albums-of-2007/) I did last year, but honestly, making it was kind of a pain in the ass because of the work involved. Especially because in lists like this things are always changing all over the place. I know some commentary on these albums would be nice, but I just don’t have the time to bother getting into that and I’d just second guess my selections again, and I want to be done living in last year. If you are shocked, apalled or curious please leave a comment and I’ll explain myself. So here, unadorned, are my 20 favourite albums of 2008:

20. Gang Gang Dance – Saint Dymphna  
19. Plants and Animals – Park Avenue  
18. Fucked Up – The Chemistry of Common Life  
17. Quiet Village – Silent Movie  
16. Bonnie Prince Billy – Lie Down in the Light  
15. Lykke Li – Youth Novels  
14. The Walkmen – You & Me  
13. Erykah Badu – New Amerykah Part One (4th World War)  
12. Shearwater – Rook  
11. DJ/Rupture – Uproot  
10. The Tallest Man on Earth – Shallow Graves  
9. Lindstrom – Where You Go I Go Too
