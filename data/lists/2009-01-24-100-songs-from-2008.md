I started this tradition [last year](http://www.radioslipstream.com/features/lists/2008/01/my-top-101-songs-from-2007/), though s[omeone else](http://www.solakov.com/) started it first a couple years ago and [continues it](http://is.gd/esWi). It’s a neat way to sum up a year of music: 100 great songs by 100 different artists. If you’re a regular listener you’ve probably already heard almost all of them but this is a chance to own their souls as it is in torrent form. So [go grab it grab it](http://tinyurl.com/dmkbnv).
