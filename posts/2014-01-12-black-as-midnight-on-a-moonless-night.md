Episode 139. [mp3](/radio/slipstream-139.mp3). Released January 12, 2014.

  
Radio Slipstream is 9 years old today.  
That’s fucked.  
So here’s another episode. A bit of a gothic tint this time around (You can probably guess by acting out some of the names). A couple of classics. Some newer witchiness, and a bit of hip hop at the end… cuz.

Also, please try to pronounce Einstürzende Neubauten loudly at friends and enemies alike.

Things to Note:  
– The kickass lyrics Nick Cave gifts to us at the end of Release the Bats (_“Baby is a cool machine/she moves to the pulse of a generator/she says damn that sex supreme/she says, she says damn that horror bat/sex horror sex bat sex horror sex vampire”_)  
– If you want to talk about the term “underrated”, check out Rowland S. Howard’s 1999 album. I’d even go so far as to use the term “hidden gem.”  
– King Krule’s awesome accent.  
– Capping it off with a self-titled album’s title track! So cool.

Hope you enjoy.
