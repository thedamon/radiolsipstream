excerpt: "This mix was inspired by and supposed, in turn, to be inspiration for a short story I wanted to write. I had an idea for a tale about snow and Christmas and trains and loneliness and trying to find warmth, but it never managed to get finished. I think this set of songs captures the intended feel very well, and it is definitely the most quietly evocative mix I have ever made. It might be perfect for what it tries to do, and that's make you sad, or at least contemplative and it might convince you it's snowing outside and you need to pull that blanket a little closer around you."

This mix was inspired by and supposed, in turn, to be inspiration for a short story I wanted to write. I had an idea for a tale about snow and Christmas and trains and loneliness and trying to find warmth, but it never managed to get finished. I think this set of songs captures the intended feel very well, and it is definitely the most quietly evocative mix I have ever made. It might be perfect for what it tries to do, and that’s make you sad, or at least contemplative and it might convince you it’s snowing outside and you need to pull that blanket a little closer around you.
