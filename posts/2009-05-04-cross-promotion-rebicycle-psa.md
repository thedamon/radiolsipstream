here’s a little something from my other life as a multimedia student:  


To make it a little more relevant to Radio Slipstream, the song in the first part of the video is Motiivi Tuntematon – Mankind Failed, which was featured in a rather [more silly than usual episode of the slipstream](http://www.radioslipstream.com/playlists/2007/07/david-suzuki-hates-toast/) (which is to say you should probably check this one out if you haven’t before).
