So it still didn’t air, even though I have the next episode all ready to go. Ridiculous? Yes. However, the Agression Session guy mentioned that tonight was their second last show. I don’t know if that has anything specific to do with the programming director being extremely pissed at them. Maybe their replacement will know how to do simple operations with winamp. One can only hope. Maybe their replacement should be me… (edit: my wish seems to have come true)
