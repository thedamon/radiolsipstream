Episode 110. [mp3](https://storage.cloud.google.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-110.mp3). [cue](https://storage.cloud.google.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-110.cue). Released March 29, 2009.

_On today’s show, we mainly look at another side of folk music; a side that is defined as such only for having minimal distortion on its guitars. That, of course, is indie-folk. Since genres mean little, there are a variety of tinges here; from country, to psych, to avant and… beyond?_
