Episode 109. [mp3](https://storage.cloud.google.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-109.mp3). [cue](https://storage.cloud.google.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-109.cue). Released March 6, 2009.

_So maybe ‘world’ music would be more descriptive, but what comparably lame puns could be made with that? … I rest my case. And anyway, why would the traditional music of British and Americans be called folk and that of Nicaraguans be called worldbeat? That’s not exactly fair. That may all be beside the point, though, because while all the music this episode is infused with the musical traditions of cultures all around the world, it’s not necessarily the traditional sort of stuff. Some of it with the modern production and arrangement. Call it worldly folk. And give it a listen, because there are some real gems here._
