A conflagration of several works in progress involving music relating to black identity (and a few *ahem* bangers). Maybe it's the coda to the never-completed history of hip hop series (which can never happen on Spotify/streaming due to the lack of availability of some pretty important artists).

Starts off jazzy and bouncy and femme (1-3), moves into politics (4-6) and pop (-9) before some straight ass kicking (11-13) back to hard politics and then jazz (14-19).
