Episode 117. [mp3](/radio/slipstream-117.mp3). [cue](/radio/slipstream-117.cue). Released August 25, 2010.

_Back for more! Still without the use of adequate microphone, this episode continues the trend of letting the music speak for itself.</p> 

Still playing catch-up as well, following that yearlong drought. So this episode features a bit of an exploration of the Chill-wave fad from last year (unless you want to call it Glo-Fi&#8230; no comment). That whole movement, thanks mostly to its bloggy pushers, steams of calculated hipster holier-than-thou pretension; but there’s a great deal of nice sounds in there as well, so don’t worry about it. After the nostalgic summer bits, you’re going to hear some low-key hip-hop, which might be labelled backpacker-rap by your snobby friends (which means it’s for college kids and not drug dealers, or something). Broadly, this set of tunes is meant to serve as a celebration and farewell to hot summer sun and vacation. So whether it’s night or day, in the basement or the beach, close your eyes and lie in the sun.</em>
