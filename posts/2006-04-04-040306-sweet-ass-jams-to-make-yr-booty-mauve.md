excerpt: This is sorta based around the DJing gig I did for the theatre and film semi formal (with the help of Marco. or really it was more like I was helping him). Only about half the songs here actually got played, but the other half I would sure have liked to.

This is sorta based around the DJing gig I did for the theatre and film semi formal (with the help of Marco. or really it was more like I was helping him). Only about half the songs here actually got played, but the other half I would sure have liked to. And man.. if people in general aren’t a little more close-minded than I thought. Unless I’m close minded for not thinking the black eyed peas are awesome. and thinking that lcd soundsystem’s tribulations is hella danceable. Oi. But maybe the regular joes are more discerning.. I mean they like only a specific group of carefully selected songs, whereas us indie blokes will like almost anything that they don’t! Well, that’s oversimplification and digression at their worst.. just enjoy the damn tracklist arright?
