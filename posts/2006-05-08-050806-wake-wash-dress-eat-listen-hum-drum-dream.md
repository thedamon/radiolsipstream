So much for summer reruns. Or more accurately, summer silence. I’m working my witty bitty pwaywists to the bone all through the summer holidays. Doing up the show in my basement in London with my dad’s studio mic and sending it through the internet to Hamilton. Of course it’s not up to me to actually put it on the radio, so I can’t guarantee you’ll actually hear it. Like this week.. nada. Those Agression Session dudes don’t like to do what they’re told or something? I guess it’s appropriate..topically? Anyway. I wonder should I bother with a new one for next week or just get this one put on? I’ll let YOU decide.

I’m going to be leaving the high quality mp3s I upload for the station up until the next showis ready, which will be less than a week after this page goes up (probably 2-3 days), so if you want it, get it fast. Someone wants these… I’ve somehow been getting hundreds and hundreds of downloads (confused! but happy!) After that I’ll put up lower quality versions (though I haven’t decided how low.. i _might_ let YOU decide).

As noted in the show, The Slipstream has changed it’s rules somewhat, as summarized below  
I, Damon Muma, host of said radioprogram do glibly swear:

1. only play gobsmackingly awesome songs that I heartily endorse the checking out of – UNCHANGED
2. make all the songs flow into each other with ease and beauty – UNCHANGED
3. never repeat an artist in a show unless there is compelling and noted reason – UNCHANGED
4. never play any song that has been played on the show before, ever, unless it is for a ‘theme’ show, and even then proceed with caution (i broke this once or twice by accident) – NOW: never play any song that has been played on the show within the last year.

I want to do some research and find out if my 20-24 new songs a week gives my show’s 2 hours a week more total songs in rotation than your typicalcrapcommercialradio station’s 168 hours a week. I wouldn’t be surprised.
