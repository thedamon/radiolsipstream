title: Crisp Multi-Grain Oat Clusters with a Touch of Honey
date: 2004-04-02T21:54:49-05:00
author: damon
excerpt: In the two weeks before this CD was made I discovered a lot of really amazing new music, mostly of the rock sort of variety. Those make up about half of the tracks here (including all the ones beginning in ‘C’), the others are some songs that have been really important to my listening pleasure in the last several months. The loose idea that started this mix was “Rock in the 2000s” to show all the ‘rock is dead’ people. Of course it stretched beyond that in order to not ignore some songs.

In the two weeks before this CD was made I discovered a lot of really amazing new music, mostly of the rock sort of variety. Those make up about half of the tracks here (including all the ones beginning in ‘C’), the others are some songs that have been really important to my listening pleasure in the last several months. The loose idea that started this mix was “Rock in the 2000s” to show all the ‘rock is dead’ people. Of course it stretched beyond that in order to not ignore some songs. Nonetheless all the songs except for tracks 5, 18, and 20 are 5 years old or younger.
