So this was the last show of the year, ostensibly until the autumn, when I shall return to Hamilton. And it turned out to be more interesting an experience than most.

First I got a call in for a request that I felt bad about not being able to fill, cause I’m just that pretentious that I don’t do requests. Or really because I spend hours getting the tracklist just so before the show and it’s fairly unstraightforward to change. Ah well, it was the only request I got and had to deny all year anyway. Then I get another call.. I _think_ it was the same guy, sounding more obviously drunk this time, asking if I wanted to go out for a latte and a haircut. I wasn’t sure if he was making fun of me or it was a joke or what, so I was just confused. I don’t like being confused. But no matter. The sweet tunes are bomping.

Things took a marked turn for the better when during El Wahrania the middle aged Mediterranean (olive-complective) janitor gave me sign language big-ups from outside the studio window. That made me happy. Damn right more people should not be scared off by music that sounds nonwestern, and thanks to [Phillip](http://www.solakov.com) for hooking me up with that and so much other music.

Then during the last set (Augie Morning Pharmacists) Daddy P, (who hosts Dope FM on CFMU and has self-reportedly been involved with various community radio stations for 15 years and I see fairly often because he’s often in the production room during my show (as he was today)), gave me a call because he was really excited that I played Gnarls Barkley (Danger Mouse + Cee Lo if that means anything) and then we chatted more and he said he thinks my show is really awesome and I should do it over the summer (sent in via mp3 upload type deal) so he can listen to it cause he likes it a lot. That made me happy. And I thought heck, why not? The roster is a bit lacking in the summer cause most people just eff off like me. It could do well for weaseling me into a better timeslot. Also, it’s what I like.

So the slipstream might just be continuing over the summer in some form or other. Prerecording doesn’t seem quite as authentic somehow, but it does allow me to be more creative I suppose. Heck, I could be downright silly if I wanted to (do I smell a mumareuther in the works?). Anyway, more news as it comes. And maybe I’ll start posting things besides radio playlists again, wouldn’t that be lovely? Cause oh yeah.. School’s Out For Summer!
