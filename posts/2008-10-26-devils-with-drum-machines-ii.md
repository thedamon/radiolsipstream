There is no originality in the world.  
3 years ago I made a [mix CD](/mixes/2005/10/devils-with-drum-machines/) based on a [radio playlist](/playlists/2005/03/032305-trillibut-kutswitchs-extra-musical-vaganza-devils-with-drum-machines/). I was never totally satisfied with it, and always intended to remake it. Eventually I decided there was enough material to just stretch it out to a full-on sequel. So here it is!

This is a dark, grimy, evil, frightening, loud, intense collection of songs. Best served with satanic rituals, vampire raves, maniac yells, grisly deaths, and that which man was never meant to know. It also has some beats of the musical variety, so feel free to see if you maybe can’t get your partially severed arm to twitch along in the groove.

If you haven’t had your Halloween party yet, you know what to do! Get the [mp3](https://storage.googleapis.com/radioslipstream/radio/mixes/devils_with_drum_machines2.mp3), get the [cue](https://storage.googleapis.com/radioslipstream/radio/mixes/devils_with_drum_machines2.cue) file (tells your music player where the track breaks are) and get evil.
