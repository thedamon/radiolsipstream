excerpt: "A right bit hard-hitting, this. Inspired by a feature on an episode back in the first season, this attempts to present some dark, pounding, hella danceable techno etc. It's a bit rougher than most of my output, but it gets the job done. It's also a companion to its follow-up, Angles With Synthesizers"
