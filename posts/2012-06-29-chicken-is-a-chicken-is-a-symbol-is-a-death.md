Episode 127. [mp3](https://storage.cloud.google.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-127.mp3). Released June 29, 2012.

Just think about the title intently as you listen to each song on this. It will all eventually make sense. No. Not that.

Highlights include: Damon finally pulls out the Mingus, real good groovin’, 2 very hard to beat covers right in a row after the dead boy, plus Dr John’s latest album is everything I could ask for.
