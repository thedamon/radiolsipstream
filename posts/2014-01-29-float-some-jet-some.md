_Some of the best hip hop tracks from this past year and a bit. Also some stone cold motherfucking classics. Starts out hard, but the back 3 quarters or so is pretty chill and melodic. You can get down with that, right?

Notes:  
– I was bound to play some Kanye, right? I feeel like I found Yeezus more underwhelming than most, but this track is toight.  
– Pharoahe Monch concludes his trilogy of rap songs from the point of view of a bullet (which started with Organized Konfusion’s [Stray Bullet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNcS5Wl2qlo "Organized Konfusion - Stray Bullet").. one of my favourite hip hops of all time (previously slipstreamed [here](http://www.radioslipstream.com/playlists/2011/12/nocturne-in-day-major/)), and continued with [When the Gun Draws](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ6-FYAngvc "Pharoahe Monch - Gun Draws official video") in 2007). Pharoahe Monch is, in my mind, one of the best Emcees ever, here’s a [great interview from Bullseye](https://soundcloud.com/bullseye-with-jesse-thorn/pharoahe-monch).  
– Check out that guest list on A$AP Rocky’s 1 Train. Who needs a hook when you have talent like that?  
– Seemed appropriate to put [Aesop Rock right next to A$AP Rocky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A29xjvbYk4U "ASAP Rocky Meets Aesop Rock at Rock the Bells"). Not usually the song you’d pick from the album, but I love the laid back vibe and the weird self-deprecating, macabre lyrics.  
– Ghostface KILLLLLAAAAH. If Ennio Morricone were to produce a rap song&#8230;  
– The De La Soul and Slum Village tracks produced by Jay Dee aka J Dilla.  
– Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst. 2 songs? Well it’s one track. And good lord is it good.  
– Kendrick Lamar’s verse on Control song made waves in the late summer of ’13. A lot of folk [had something to say about it](http://www.vibe.com/photo-gallery/clap-back-ranking-best-and-worst-responses-kendrick-lamars-control-verse "Clap Back: Ranking The Best (And Worst) Responses To Kendrick Lamar's 'Control' Verse"). Jay Electronica’s verse is also awesome. I almost edited out Big Sean’s.</em>  
– Continuing on a theme&#8230; Andre 3000’s guest verse on &#8216;Sorry’ is beautiful, personal, lyrical. What an incredible emcee.  
– Killer Mike’s 2012 collaboration with El-P is really, really good. So is his [free](http://foolsgoldrecs.com/runthejewels/ "Download Run the Jewels") 2013 even-more-collaboration with El-P.  
– Cunninlynguists have a pretty awesome thing going (especially when it comes to Kno’s production), but after 4 albums with nearly the same sound I’m getting harder to impress.  
– Sunday’s best has a follow-up track called [Monday’s worst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBNpwFPVo1Y "Black Milk - Sunday's Best / Monday's Worst (Official Video)"). Worth checkin.  
– 9 years in and I finally play a track from Outkast’s first album. Southernplayalisticadillacmusik is 20 this year and Outkast is touring for the first time in like 9 years or something (with the internet you’d think I’d be able to figure that number out).  
– Danny Brown put out one of 2013’s best rap albums. This track is older, though, and reminds one of even older than that.  
– Not much to say about Tribe and Black Star. I mean.. yeah. (and R.I.P. Lou Reed)  
– Bit K.R.I.T has put out a series of well-above-average mixtapes and this track is one of his best. Bun B almost steals the show, though.. I just love his voice on this.  
– smooov.
