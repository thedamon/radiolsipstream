A paen to the idea of travel when travel is fleeting.
Though travel is always fleeting. But for some time it hasn't even been.
Sometimes, with a deep sigh, it feels like it never will be.
Openness. Freedom. Moving toward a fixed point. 

Road trippy stuff, and a chance to work through a backlog of folksy tunes.
