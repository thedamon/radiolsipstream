Episode 136. [mp3](https://storage.cloud.google.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-136.mp3). Released September 02, 2013.

Some great tunes in here, all pushing at a feeling. The feeling of a turning page. A change in the air. Air heavy and muggy but cooling and drifting with a sharp billowing wind. Blowing out of somewhere for the last time and pausing for a second to remember.</p>

featured genres in no particular condescending order: folk, artpop, folky artpop, altfolk, altalt, dreampop, heartsleeve, postrock, preposterous protoprepostrock, classical recomposition, dietsoda, avantpop, organic demi-glaze cabbage
