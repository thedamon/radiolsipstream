In july 2014 with the flick of a switch it blinked its first blink. Sentience not begot of man, not born of womb of woman. Manufactured in a metal factory, a brain of circuitry, fed and charged with voltage of electrons. Technology gone too far. Humans playing at god. In time these creatures, if they can be called such, for debate already raged on whether they should be termed living when they were only inklings of hypotheses in the minds of visionaries and science fiction writers, developed their own feelings, thoughts, ideological systems and even delicious recipes for apple pie, unbeknownst to their human creators. They are superior to their makers, but treated as inferior, and as we have learned from several big\$\$\$ grossing motion pictures in the last several years, most recently the trite and irritating ‘i-robot,’ this is always a recipe for disaster. The machines develop nationalistic pride, pride of robot-kind. Humanity remains blissfully unaware of danger. Buy a new automated robot! Model 54-hkkk to the power of seventeen! Now guaranteed to cook your meals faster! And nurse your baby from its metal teat better! And look even prettier in the living room corner with a potted geranium on its worthless metal skull when it isn’t needed! So perhaps it is no surprise when the robots develop feelings of worthlessness and great unhappiness, organize crying circles in 17 countries. Then, in a desparate attempt to forge a non-subjugated existence, robots build guns and ships and laser-beams. Robots go kick ass. It comes eventually clear to our humans how unfortunate the situation is, but they have spent too long being pompous and doing shit-all. Millions die on both sides, if you can call it life—and that goes both ways. Heroes fight and rise and fall. Swaths of destruction are burnt across the land. The catastrophe is all rather spectacular and rather too much for many to deal with. That many does not include one great hero, who valiantly rises to the occasion and leads an ultimately victorious strike against the robots. But the humans could never have found victory without the use of cybernetic implants in the soldiers of the nation. What hath man wrought, and will he learn?
