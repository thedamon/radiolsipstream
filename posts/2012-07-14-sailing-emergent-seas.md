Episode 128. [mp3](https://storage.googleapis.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-128.mp3). Released July 14, 2012.

As far as invalidating genres, there’s two types of rather divergent ‘garage’ music on here. Mostly though it’s a half of dubby techno and a half of darkish hip hop bookended by proto and posto punkishness. The overall feeling is a bit heavy and unnerving. In a good way of course.</p>

Special shout out to Clams Casino for his production on ‘The Fall’ (and a number of tracks in previous episodes), El-P for his production on Untitled and all of the fantastic R.A.P. Music (and his own track two songs later), and Suicide for showing up to do the original version of the song Neneh Cherry and The Thing covered last time.
