Episode 130. [mp3](/radio/slipstream-130.mp3). Released September 28, 2012.

A lot of songs on parade here that have been in the queue for a long time (Yea, I got a queue of songa waiting for their time to shine. It goes back 5 years, and not as much has been coming out of it lately; you could say there was a bit of a blockage, but please don’t).

A bit of a gamut, but mostly I think you could call it electronica and indie pop/rock.
