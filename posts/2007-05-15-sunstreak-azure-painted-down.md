<p class="note_content clearfix">
  So I wrote a little blurb here and then my computer crashed.
</p>

In short(ish):

Missed regular radio show last week, was supposed to be at CocoRosie concert but band got arrested, stayed in London instead.

Did stand in radio show.

Stand in radio show (sans tongue wagging) was essentially a mix cd I’ve been working on extensively of late padded out to fill the 2 hours.

Asterisk means not on the “cd version” lol. Listen to it here: <a href="/radio/slipstream-may14.mp3" target="_blank" title="http://slipstream.brokenuniverse.com/radio/upload/slipstream-may14.mp3">\_\_\_\_</a>
