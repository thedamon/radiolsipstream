excerpt: "Around Christmas 2006 I made a trio of mix CDs because it'd been a while since I made any. I had a pretty good stash of songs lying around, so things were looking up. This one started from culling through the sets of songs I was most pleased with from the previous summer and sprinkling in new ones as required. It of course changd a lot in the process, but the result is one I am almost perfectly happy with. This one is probably my most easily likable mix and has a good mix of fast and slow."

Around Christmas 2006 I made a trio of mix CDs because it’d been a while since I made any. I had a pretty good stash of songs lying around, so things were looking up. This one started from culling through the [sets of songs I was most pleased with](/?p=68) from the previous summer and sprinkling in new ones as required. It of course changd a lot in the process, but the result is one I am almost perfectly happy with. This one is probably my most easily likable mix and has a good mix of fast and slow.
