Episode 113. [mp3](https://storage.googleapis.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-113.mp3). [cue](https://storage.googleapis.com/radioslipstream/radio/slipstream-113.cue). Released June 3, 2009.

_Witness! The fastest turnaround since going off the air of CFMU on 10/27/07. Some stranger sounds kicking things off. Dense, odd and awesome, then some slightly experimental folky sort of things, moving toward some general pop rocking. A bit of an eclectic beast for you this time, but if you keep it fed it will give you years of joy._
