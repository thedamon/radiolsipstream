excerpt: |
  A collection of some songs with a sort of delicate drive to 'em. Dare I say sensual? Well, sure. That would apply to most music wouldn't it?
  There was a bit of bum track in it originally, so two years later or so I took it upon myself to redo it slightly (tracks 8 and 9 are the additions)
