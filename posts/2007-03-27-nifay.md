excerpt: "This little piece of work was created in conjunction with me starting to have thoughts about writing a story about some sort of weird faerie sort of somethings living in a park downtown and pestering people for change and generally being confused with homeless people. There's more on that over at my personal site. The music on this, though, is all rather grimy or dark and violent or at the very least, spooky with hopefully a muddy ethereal quality. Most of my mixes steer towards the more melodic and listenable side of my musical taste, but it's fun to stray away from that and I may do it more."

This little piece of work was created in conjunction with me starting to have thoughts about writing a story about some sort of weird faerie sort of somethings living in a park downtown and pestering people for change and generally being confused with homeless people. There’s more on that over at my personal site. The music on this, though, is all rather grimy or dark and violent or at the very least, spooky with hopefully a muddy ethereal quality. Most of my mixes steer towards the more melodic and listenable side of my musical taste, but it’s fun to stray away from that and I may do it more.
