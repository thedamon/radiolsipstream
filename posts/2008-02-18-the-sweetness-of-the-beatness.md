[Episode 97](/radio/slipstream-97.mp3). Released February 18, 2008

_This one: much less with the jibber jabber as it’s a 2 hour nonstop electronic dancing music experience! House, techno, breaks, some hip hop and pop, and a whole lot of goodness. Watch in astonishment as the songs flow together like orange juice and grape juice swirling in a river of fruity bliss!! Marvel at the sweetness of the beatness!!! OH! DEAR! GOD! YES! </p> 

That said, if you’re one of those people who can’t stand ‘electronic’ music, you might want to wait a couple weeks.

Phil’s torrent of songs is [here](http://www.mininova.org/tor/1099864) (his 2006 one gave me the idea to do [my own](http://www.radioslipstream.com/features/lists/2008/01/my-top-101-songs-from-2007/)), and I’d also like to mention that this episode includes the 1000th (and 1001st!) unique artist to be featured on Radio Slipstream.</em>
