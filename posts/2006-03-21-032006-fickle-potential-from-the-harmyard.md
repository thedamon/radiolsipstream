**Special Behind the Scenes Featurette:**  
So just as I was about to head to the station I realized I never actually burned the second CD I was going to use for the show tonight. See, I pre crossfade all the tracks and everything so it can sound delicious and nice.. as long as it’s done. So I burned it a little last minute, decided to make use of my seatless bicycle to get to the station sooner, and upon getting there the CD player didn’t accept it. So during the David Broughton set I raced home to start a new CD-RW burning (just out of the wrapper to try and guarantee no funny stuff). I managed to get back to the station with just a tad of dead air. It appears my bicycle muscles have atrophied. Then during the Jelineklambdiplo set I did the whole thing again to grab the freshly burned and thankfully working CD. That all goes to explain the out of breathiness and lack of anything interesting to say due to high levels of fatigue. Yeah I’m probably insane and take the radio thing a tad too seriously. Oh well. More interesting than anything else that happened today! The unintellibility of the above is entirely related to the absence of my mind. Sleeptimeyes?
