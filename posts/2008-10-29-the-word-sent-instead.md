Episode 105. [mp3](/radio/slipstream-105.mp3). [cue](/radio/slipstream-105.cue). Released October 29, 2008

_Starts sparse and wisftul with acoustic and electronic turns, then it hip hops, then it gets down and dirty out in the countryside and town. I would say this episode can generally be described as gritty but still captures a wide array of different sounds. I would also say that it’s a pretty killer selection of tunes and you’d do well to be listening in! … Please?_
