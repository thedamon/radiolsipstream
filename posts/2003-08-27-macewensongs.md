excerpt: This was my first all out grand production of a mix CD with cover and everything, hours and hours went into it, as is often the case when doing things where computers like to cause errors. It breaks some rules (ie only one song per artist, which is a rule I ignored until basically 2005). I made this mix for Melissa (and perhaps a little for myself as well) when I and she left the proximity of each other and trundled off to McMaster and Queens respectively (that’s where the lame name that i’ve given it comes from).

This was my first all out grand production of a mix CD with cover and everything, hours and hours went into it, as is often the case when doing things where computers like to cause errors. It breaks some rules (ie only one song per artist, which is a rule I ignored until basically 2005). I made this mix for Melissa (and perhaps a little for myself as well) when I and she left the proximity of each other and trundled off to McMaster and Queens respectively (that’s where the lame name that i’ve given it comes from). I don’t know if she ever actually listened to the whole thing, but I at least think it is really good. Some really nice transitions, and a lovely little end. The version here is a slightly updated one that I made more recently where Wonderwall by Oasis was replaced with The Devlins.
