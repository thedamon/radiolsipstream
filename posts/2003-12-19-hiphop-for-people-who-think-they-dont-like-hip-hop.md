excerpt: Lots of people don’t much like hiphop. My theory is that they just think they don’t and they haven’t heard the really good stuff. The idea behind this CD is basically that. A wide selection of honest to God downright awesome hiphop from most of my favourite hip hop purveyors. So if you like the beats and rhymes already, you’ll hopefully like this, and if you don’t then you can learn something!
