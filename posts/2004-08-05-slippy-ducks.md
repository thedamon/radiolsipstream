This lovely plot of musical perfection began as an attempt to put all the tracks at the top of Winamp’s ‘Most Played’ list (except those already committed to mixes) in one happy little place. It expanded to include some forgotten gems and some classics begging to be mixed (The Bjork and the Orbital were runners up for MACEWEN). The Orbital song got excised in the recent reversioning. Perhaps it will show up somewhere again. More electronica songs snuck their way into this mix than is the standard with my output, and that is largely intentional because that facet of my listening experience has been largely under-represented… until now! (ooh and ahh, please). And in the end only 4 of the originally slated songs remain. I would say this is probably my most diverse mix so far. There are some strange and wholly wonderful sounds contained within.
