Notes: Four Tet = Kieren Hebden = was in Fridge (as was Adem). I actually went and looked that up during the show after I wasn’t sure, and then forgot to mention it. Squarepusher is one of the pioneers of IDM and is really just one guy, Tom Jenkinson, and is (I am informed) not to be made fun of. He plays bass really well.  
The levels seemed really too high on the web-stream (hence the blatantly loud mp3 and resultant decrease in quality), but at the station they were where they normally are, if not a little lower. Might be a problem with the stream itself. I’ll try to look into it so further shows are snappier and crisper.

**NEXT WEEK!**: creepy, terrifying ambience and music in honour of the eve of all hallows. hide the children. suggestions requested! requests suggested! (as long as they’re well in advance)
