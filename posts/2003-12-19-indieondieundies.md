excerpt: This here had its inception because the hiphop mix I was working on was to be a Secret Santa gift for someone whose musical tastes I didn’t know in and out. Not knowing whether he liked hip hop, I figured it would be a good idea to provide an additional CD that would cover the other spectrum of music.. the more guitar and voice side of things, with some variance of course.

This here had its inception because the hiphop mix I was working on was to be a Secret Santa gift for someone whose musical tastes I didn’t know in and out. Not knowing whether he liked hip hop, I figured it would be a good idea to provide an additional CD that would cover the other spectrum of music.. the more guitar and voice side of things, with some variance of course. Turned out very lovely-like, though I had to go back and replace a U2 track (I included it largely because I knew Adam was a huge U2 fan, as well as because I really like it of course) with some Decemberists.
