  Being a collection of songs representing the most favourite of songs enjoyed in 2006 (not necessarily, but principally, being songs originating in 2006). It starts off gentle, ramps up in intensity, gets rather forceful, eases off with a bit of dance-club frivolity, and then enters into a sweeping streak of cinematic epicosity where you get self-actualized and have suns exploding in your heart.
  In retrospect, this is not my most favourite of mixes, but all the songs are damn good!

Being a collection of songs representing the most favourite of songs enjoyed in 2006 (not necessarily, but principally, being songs originating in 2006).

This disc sort of has a theme, but definitely has a flow. It starts off gentle, ramps up in intensity, gets rather forceful, eases off with a bit of dance-club frivolity, and then enters into a sweeping streak of cinematic epicosity where you get self-actualized and have suns exploding in your heart.

I also found that a lot of the songtitles seem to go together… having to do with time and loss and new beginnings. but that is almost purely coincidental. Also, in retrospect, this is not my most favourite of mixes at all, but all the songs are good!
