This was in general going to be an autumnal compilation of crispy air songs to herald a young boy moving into a new home and setting up a new life, the hope, the thrills, the fright, and the required inherent nostalgia. That doesn’t really come across here, because it changed around quite a lot. But yeah, I hope you like it anyway. Boom.<!--more-->
